When we created **Y**et **A**nother **D**emo **M**odeler (**YADM**), our goal was to develop a simple, lightweight browser native modeling tool, built on modern web standards.

YADM is based on the [ReactFlow](https://www.reactflow.io) framework. Designed with privacy and efficiency in mind, its architecture stores all data and state locally within the userâ€™s browser.
For a clean and accessible interface, YADM uses a headless UI powered by [Adobe Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/).
Built-in [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) allows effortless translation and localization.

The application does not communicate with external servers, store cookies, or track user activity.

We believe that a modern, browser-native tool should give you the freedom to create without compromise. By building on open standards and focusing on privacy, YADM aims to deliver a future-proof experience free from vendor lock-in.
